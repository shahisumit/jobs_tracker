# What is jobs_tracker

### What is the repo about?
- Assume you want to apply for jobs to specific companies that you care about. In addition, assume, you only want the notifications to specific category of jobs, example, data analyst or, economist. 
- We want to create a repo that will allow you to quickly do it and gives you the flexibility the extend it.

### Benefits
- Given the size of the database you need, you can easily store everything in your local box.
- Set up your email and cron job. Then, you are done. (Well, thats the plan.)
- Add companies you want. If the companies are not listed, extend it yourself and contribute to this project.

### Supported OS system
- In Linux boxes only for now.

### Supported Organizations
- texastribune

# Planned feature extension
- add Joblisting link: allow for pattern in  a list, allow for xpath addition
- Allow Postgres and SQLite option (or more as needed)
- Add front end functionality to add job websites to database
- Use containerize services
- Use scrapy and handle data pipeline through scrapy pipeline
- Create a table with a organization's website, its name, jobs website, ats if exists.

### Personal motivation
- In addition to the above annoyance about checking jobs everyday, I wanted to use bash as much as possible in this project (just for learning purposes). I am not against other language ideas.
